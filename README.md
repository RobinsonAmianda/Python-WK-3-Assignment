📘 Discount Calculator

A simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.
It demonstrates how to use functions, conditionals, and user input in Python.

🌍 Overview

This program lets you enter:

The original price of an item

The discount percentage

👉 If the discount is 20% or higher, it applies the discount.
👉 If the discount is less than 20%, the price remains the same.

This approach is practical in real-world scenarios like shopping apps, e-commerce sites, and billing systems, where certain discount rules are applied.

🛠️ How It Works

User enters:

The original price (e.g., 100)

The discount percentage (e.g., 25)

The program checks:

If discount ≥ 20 → applies discount

Else → returns original price

Output: Shows the final price with or without discount.

👩‍💻 Example (Techy View)
Enter the original price of the item: 200
Enter the discount percentage: 25
Discount applied! Final price: $150.00


If the discount was 10%, you’d get:

Enter the original price of the item: 200
Enter the discount percentage: 10
No discount applied. Price remains: $200.00

📦 Example Use Cases

🛒 E-commerce → Apply discounts during checkout


🎓 Learning → Great exercise for beginners learning functions & conditionals in Python

🎯 Key Takeaways (Non-Techy)

Think of this program as a smart calculator for shopping discounts.

If a store offers 20% or more, it will lower the price.

If it’s less than 20%, it tells you no discount applies.

Simple, fair, and easy to use! ✅
